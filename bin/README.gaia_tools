% fred_gaia_inputs.py [--help][-k key][-v variable][-o operation][-t vis_type][other options]
    -k or --key       Fred Key (no default)
    -r or --run       (Not Working) The run number of vizualize
    -v or --variable   The variable from FRED you would like to plot.
                       Available variables are actually determined by FRED but here are some
		       examples:
		       N - Populaton Density
		       C - Newly exposed persons
		       P - Prevalence
		       I - Number of people infectious
                       (default: C)
    -t or --type       Type of GAIA visualization
                       static = a static image
		       animated = a ogg movie of the visualization
                       (default: static)
    -o or --op         Operation to perform on the data (only for static)
                       sum = will sum up all of the data over days of simulation
		       max = will only take the maximum value for each grid over days of simulation
		       (Note if -v is set to N and -t is set to static, this is always max).
                       (default: sum)
    -m or --movformat  Format you would like the movie in (only for -t animated)
                       mov - produces quicktime movie
		       mp4 - produces mp4 movie
		       ogg - procudes ogg movie (default)
    -T or --title      Title for the visualization
    -p or --percents   If set, will plot the percentage of the value in each grid cell. (default: off) 
    -l or --loc        FRED Location file to use (if blank will try to use the one from input)


Running this script will take the information in the $FRED_HOME/RESULTS directory for the particular
key and calls the GAIA webservice to return visualizations.  This program is meant to be run after 
a fred_job execution is complete, as post processing.

FRED_HOME must be defined for this script to work, and FRED has to have been run for the particular key.

Once run, the visualizations will appear in the current directory with the name 
fred_gaia_<key>_<realizaton>.<viz>.

Notes:

Currently, this is not optimal for large simulation runs.  If you are going to run these with large 
data sets, please make sure that you have a decent amount of memory.  


PyPy

	If one would like to improve performance of these scripts significantly (about 10x), 
	please install pypy.  You can download this software at:

	http://pypy.org/

	If you are on OS X, it is recommended to download the nightly snapshot, as the latest 
	stable release is defective on Snow Leopard (may work on Lion).

	To install PyPy, just download the program, unzip it some where, and then place the pypy 
	program before the fred_gaia_inputs.py in the command line.

	So...
