To use the following scxripts, set the environmental variable $FRED_HOME
to the location of your FRED source directory.

% run_fred [-p paramsfile | -k key]

Runs FRED with the given parameter file in a working directory created
in the $FRED_HOME/RESULTS directory, and asscoaited the working
directory with the key.  If the -p option is omitted, the file "params"
is assumed.  If the -k option is omitted, an internally generated key is
generated.  In either case, the key is return, printed on standard
output.  Will terminate if the user supplied key has already been used.
If given a copy of a previous params file, run_fred associates the key
with previous id, and does not re-run FRED.  The script sets the STATUS
of the request (see fred_status below).  When FRED finishes, run_fred
runs stats to collect data on S, E, I, R, I_s, M, and AR.

% fred_status -k key [-s secs]

Prints the status of the FRED run associated with the given key.  If -s
option is given, repeats status report every secs seconds.

% fred_AR -k key

Returns mean and std dev of attack rate (AR) for run associated with
key.

% fred_plot -k key -v [S|E|I|R|s|M]

Creates a plot of one or more of the indicated measures for the
indicated run.  The plot file (type PNG) is stored in RESULTS under the
run's REPORT directory.  Prints the full path to the plot file.

% fred_display_plot -k key -v [S|E|I|R|s|M]

Runs fred_plot and then opens the resulting plot file (using Preview on
Macs).

% fred_chain -k key -r realization -a agent -d depth

Extracts from the appropriate tracefile all lines pertaining to agent a
and any agent subsequently infected by a, to depth d.  Prints the full
path to the resulting file.
