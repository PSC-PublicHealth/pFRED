= Coderev - simple code review tool =

== Overview ==

Code review before check in code changes is a must in most projects, but what
will you do if you want other developers to review your changes?  Send them
the diff generated by "svn diff" or "cvs diff" or something else?  I beleive
that would bring a lot of pain to the reviewers - raw diffs are difficult to
read when you changed many lines.

Coderev is just the thing you need for effective code review.  Coderev is a
quite simple and small toolkit that can

  * Compares files/dirs and generates side-by-side html pages
  * Generates side-by-side html pages on your SVN working copy
  * More (TODO)

== Status ==

Basic function is already implemented on top of python difflib.

== Usage ==

Checkout trunk revision http://code.google.com/p/coderev/source/checkout or
download from http://code.google.com/p/coderev/downloads/list and extract the
tarball to your disk, there are two tools present for you - codediff.py (to
compare files/dirs) and coderev.sh (to generate code review page on your svn
work space).

Type './codediff.py -h' for codediff.py usage.

Type './coderev.sh -h' for coderev.sh usage.
