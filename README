COMPILING SYNDEM

% make

INPUT FILES

SYNDEM requires the following files (default filename in brackets)

Parameter file [ params ]
	contains all run-time parameters in format:
	name = value
	dist_name = max_days <cdf>
	where <cdf> is the cumulative distribution function,
	      for day 0..max_days
	
Location File [loc.txt]
	contains one line per location, with format:
	place_id external_id type longitude latitude

Population File [ pop.txt ]
	one line per person with format:
	agent_id age sex

Schedule file [ sched.txt ]
	 list of places visited by each agent for each day of week,
	 with format:
	 agent_id day_of_week place_id

The default input files were created from the Allegheny County synthetic
population files, as follows:

% make_alleg
% parse_alleg

RUNNING SYNDEM

% SYNDEM [ paramsfile ]

With no argument, Syndem read "params" to get the runtime parameters.
You can specify an alternative parameter file on the command line, e.g.

% SYNDEM params.test

The file "go" contains a shell script to run SYNDEM, process the output
files and plot the epi curve (requires gnuplot).

OUTPUT FILES

SYNDEM produces two kinds of output files, where <n> is the run number
(starting with 1):

out<n>.txt: Daily S-E-I-R report for each disease.

trace<n>.txt: One line per infected agent, with format:

status agent_id age sex occ date_exposed date_infectious date_recovered
       number_of_places type_of_place_infected place_id_infected
       infector infectees


PARAMETERS

[ Coming soon. ]

CLASSES

Current Classes:
- Disease
- Place
- Person

Disease Class:
- Prob of becoming symptomatic;
- Transmissibility
- Latentcy distribution
- Incubation distribution
- Infectious distribution

Each distribution is represented as a cumulative distribution function,
for example, if the length of time for being infectious is uniformly
distributed between 1 and 5 days, the distribution is represented as {
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 }.

Place Class:
- type (HOME, WORK, SCHOOL, COMMUNITY)
- lat and lon
- Number of potential visitors
- for each disease:
-- local transmissibility
-- local contacts per day
-- list of susceptible visitors
-- list of infectious visitors
-- counters for S and I


Person Class:
- Demographics: age, sex, occupation

- For each disease:
-- status: S, E, I, R
-- dates for each status
-- Vaccination status per vaccine (not implemented)
-- status: vaccinated or not, dates of vaccination (not implemented)
-- Place infected
-- Infector agent
-- Susceptibility
-- Infectivity

- List of places potentially visited (static)
- Daily schedules: list of places to be visited each day of week
- Rules for travel (not implemented)
- Rules for changing schedules (not implemented)
- Rules for compliance (not implemented)
