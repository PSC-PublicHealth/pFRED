    Moved the trunk as imported from cvs into branches/ParameterDiseaseName_rev-2_8_0.  This branch includes the changes from r2152 to r2174 where disease specific params are referred to by string name rather that integer index.  The apollo-2_8_0 branch (r2030 branchpoint) was re-based as the new trunk (svn copy branches/apollo-2_8_0 trunk); The changes between r2030 and r2152 are likely harmless (still compatible with apollo), but offer little incentive to make merge worthwhile; refs #408

    Added two collective operations to the Tracker class:
    
    1. Resetting all integer and double values to zero.
    2. Setting one of the keys for all indexes in the Tracker to a value.
    
    This allows me to have a daily counter that can be printed out to the same file.
    
    Updated unit test to ping this feature and make sure that it is working.

    Updated Tracker class to be a template and operate a little differently than before.
    
    Now the class can store counts by any type one would like to use, with the caveat
    that it can be printed.  This means at the moment, there is not a capacity to use
    user derived types, but should be trivial to add this in the future.
    
    Also added a Unit test to TestSuite to test the class.  You can see that there is now
    a main function in the TestSuite/Tracker directory that is able to easily compiler
    without the use of FRED at all.  I added a rule to Makefile for compiling this:
    
    make FRED_Unit_Tracker
    
    Shows us a guide on how to add unit tests trivially for classes, and made it much
    much easier to develop and debug this as an independent class.
    wq
    There is no change to the regression test.

    Added the Tracker Class that allows one to track daily counts from anywhere in FRED.

    This effects the order of the variables in out, and so I will be subsequently be checking
    in an update to the regression test.
